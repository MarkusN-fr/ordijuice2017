Description: ordijuice offers the possibility to use some functionalities 
    provided by the JUICE software (see: http://www.sci.muni.cz/botany/juice/) 
    involving R. JUICE is a non-commercial software package for editing and 
    analysing phytosociological data. ordijuice provides the necessary 
    functions to link JUICE and R, and to perform ordinations on data from 
    JUICE in a non-interactive R-session. Therefore, this package is NOT 
    intended to be used without JUICE, or in an interactive R-session, since 
    all the data and function-arguments are provided by JUICE.
